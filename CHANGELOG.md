### Patch 0.1.0

Youtubetobibtex is a small library to export information from a YouTube video in a bibtex format.

The bibtex looks like :

```
@online{video:tomscott2019,
    title = {Why Electronic Voting Is Still A Bad Idea},
    date = {2019},
    organization = {YouTube},
    author = {Tom Scott},
    url = {https://youtube.com/watch?v=LkH2r-sNjQs},
}
```
